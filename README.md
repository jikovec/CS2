## Contents

- **autoexec.cfg**  
  A comprehensive, pro‑level autoexec configuration for CS2. It covers main settings, crosshair, HUD, radar, mouse, viewmodel, network, FPS & video, sound, scripts, and key bindings—all optimized for performance and clarity on a 5:4 resolution monitor.

- **autoexec_nades.cfg**  
  A training configuration designed specifically for practicing grenade throws. It enables cheats, grants infinite ammo, sets extended round times, and removes freeze and warmup delays, making it ideal for focused practice sessions.

- **autoexec_bunnyhop.cfg**  
  This config is geared toward bunnyhopping practice. It adjusts various movement variables—eliminating stamina restrictions, increasing air acceleration, and even displaying positional data—to help you refine your technique.

- **autoexec_demoui.cfg**  
  Optimized for demo review, this configuration minimizes distractions by disabling post‑processing, fog, and non‑essential HUD elements. It also sets a custom field‑of‑view and skybox for consistent, clear visuals when analyzing demos.

- **autoexec_troll_crosshair.cfg**  
  A fun “troll” crosshair configuration that creates an exaggerated, oversized crosshair. This setup is meant for experimentation or lighthearted sessions rather than competitive play.

  Optimizes network settings for low latency, adjusts viewmodel and HUD settings for a 5:4 display, and includes comprehensive key bindings and scripts for competitive play.

- **Training Nades:**
  Tailored for grenade practice, this config removes time limits and freeze periods, allowing for uninterrupted training sessions. Money settings are maximized to let you purchase any equipment you need.

- **Bunnyhop Config:**
  Eliminates or minimizes stamina limitations and enhances air acceleration to help you practice advanced bunnyhop techniques. Positional data is displayed for additional feedback.

- **Demo UI Config:**
  Ideal for analyzing demos, this file disables post‑processing and fog, sets a custom FOV and skybox, and reduces HUD clutter for a distraction‑free viewing experience.

## Additional Suggestions

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  If CS2 supports additional debugging tools (such as net graphs or new demo UI commands), consider integrating these to monitor performance in real time.

- **Keybind Toggles:**  
  You might add keybinds to quickly toggle between your competitive and training configs, or even between different crosshair setups.

- **Regular Updates:**  
  As CS2 evolves, keep an eye on new console variables and adjust your configs accordingly. Maintaining versioned backups will help you revert if necessary.
